# Figure Rendering and Manuscript Mockups

Human goal: preserve reusable code for figure-panel rendering, figure-layout mockups, and manuscript visual planning.

This project is separate from JM105-specific analysis. Code belongs here when its main purpose is layout/rendering rather than calculating biological metrics.

## Intended structure

```text
projects/figure-rendering/
  nature-aging-mockups/
    Reusable figure-layout and journal-style mockup scripts.
  panel-renderers/
    Standalone panel rendering utilities.
  templates/
    Style/layout templates and reusable configuration files.
```

## Guardrails

- Do not fake data.
- Preserve original panel aspect ratios unless resizing is explicitly allowed.
- Avoid text overlap, spillover, irrelevant panels, and unused whitespace.
- Clearly distinguish existing panels from newly required panels.
- If data are absent, mark the panel as `NO DATA`.

## Canonical code status

No verified canonical figure-rendering script has been imported yet.

When imported, use human names such as:

- `nature-aging-mockups/render-main-figure-layouts.py`
- `nature-aging-mockups/score-figure-story-architecture.py`
- `panel-renderers/render-no-data-placeholder.py`
